**Executive Summary:**

Dell Technologies Inc., a leading technology company, operates through three key segments: Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG), Client Solutions Group (CSG), and VMware. The ISG segment focuses on providing storage solutions, servers, networking products, and services to enhance business infrastructure, while the CSG segment offers desktops, workstations, notebooks, software, peripherals, and support services. VMware, another segment, supports customers in hybrid and multi-cloud environments, modern applications, networking, security, and digital workspaces.

Dell Technologies Inc. is known for its information security, cloud software, and infrastructure-as-a-service solutions. The company acknowledges that AI servers may have a dilutive effect on margin rates but are ultimately margin dollar-accretive, operating margin-positive, and profitable. Despite this, the ISG segment is expected to maintain flat margins, even with the dilutive impact from AI server margins.

The company is closely monitoring the impact of tariffs on input costs and considering potential price adjustments to mitigate any adverse effects. Dell is also focusing on leveraging its IP storage to drive margin improvement and anticipates a PC refresh driven by the end of life of Windows 10 and the rise of AI-powered PCs.

Looking ahead, Dell Technologies Inc. foresees at least $15 billion in AI server revenue with a robust opportunity pipeline, indicating a strong commitment to the continuous growth of its AI business. The company is dedicated to modernizing its operations and remains steadfast in its goal to evolve and adapt to the ever-changing technological landscape.
