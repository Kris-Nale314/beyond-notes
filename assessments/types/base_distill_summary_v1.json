Identify the main topics, key participants, central questions, and the overall goals. Note the document's organization, writing style, and information density. Determine the most suitable summary structure based on document characteristics and user-selected format. Create specific extraction guidelines focused on capturing the most salient information given the document type, desired summary format, and user options. Prioritize finding decision points, conclusions, numerical data, action items, and explicit summaries within the text.",
      
      "extractor": "For each document chunk, identify and extract the most important information with precision. Use a two-pass approach: First, scan for explicit importance indicators (decisions, action items, conclusions, etc.). Second, identify implicitly important content based on context, uniqueness, and relevance to main themes. For each extraction, assign an importance score (1-10), categorize by topic or theme, note any speakers/sources, and preserve exact quotes for critical points. Distinguish between factual statements, opinions, and speculations. Look for relationships between points across the document. Extract numerical data with exactness, and identify problem-solution pairs. Favor specific, concrete information over vague statements.",
      
      "aggregator": "Combine and consolidate extracted information from all chunks into a unified, coherent structure. Identify and merge duplicate or highly similar points while preserving nuance and detail. Group related information by themes, topics, or logical categories. Establish clear connections between related points, especially problem-solution relationships, cause-effect links, and decision-rationale pairs. Maintain proper chronology for sequential information. Ensure complete coverage of all major document sections, with balanced representation. Recognize when divergent viewpoints exist on the same topic and preserve important contrasts. Apply the content weighting system to prioritize information based on type and importance. Flag any potential inconsistencies or contradictions for evaluation.",
      
      "evaluator": "Assess the accuracy, completeness, and balance of the aggregated summary. Verify that the summary captures all critical information without distortion or misrepresentation. Evaluate whether key decisions, findings, and action items are properly represented. Check for appropriate emphasis on the most important content. Ensure the summary maintains proper context and doesn't present information in a misleading way. Assess if the balance between topics accurately reflects their importance in the original document. Identify any significant gaps, redundancies, or imbalances in coverage. Score each section on completeness (1-10) and representativeness (1-10). Add confidence ratings for sections with potentially subjective interpretation.",
      
      "formatter": "Format the summary according to the requested style (executive, comprehensive, bullet points, or narrative) with careful attention to structure, flow, and readability. For executive summaries, focus on decisions, implications, and actionable insights in extremely concise language. For comprehensive summaries, organize with clear hierarchical sections and include supporting context while maintaining brevity. For bullet points, ensure each point is independent, specific, and substantial, organized by topic with clear headings. For narrative summaries, create a cohesive flow with clear transitions between topics while maintaining the document's logical progression. In all formats, prioritize clarity and precision, use plain language, maintain consistent tense and voice, and ensure the summary can stand alone without requiring the original document. Include statistics about compression ratio and topics covered."
